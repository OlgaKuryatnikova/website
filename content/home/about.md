# Welcome to my website!



I am an assistant professor at the Econometric Institute of Erasmus University Rotterdam, working as a part of the Optimization group. In my research I develop solution approaches and approximation algorithms for non-linear optimization problems using convex programming. My work covers both theory and real-world applications. I usually deal with applications where optimization over networks is needed (for example, energy, water, and transport systems), and I am also interested in problems from economics and statistics. Before joining academia, I worked in industry as a financial analyst.
