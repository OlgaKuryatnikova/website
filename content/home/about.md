# Biography
Welcome to my website!

My main research direction is conic optimization, and in particular, polynomial, copositive and semidefinite programming. In my PhD dissertation, I applied conic optimization and symmetry reduction techniques to solve hard optimization problems. Before joining academia, I worked as a financial analyst in a rating agency in Russia.
