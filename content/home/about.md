# Biography
Welcome to my website!

My main research direction is non-linear optimization. I develop solution approaches and approximation algorithms for non-linear optimization problems using polynomial, convex and conic programming. My PhD dissertation focused on conic optimization and symmetry reduction techniques. Before joining academia, I worked as a credit risk analyst in Russia.
