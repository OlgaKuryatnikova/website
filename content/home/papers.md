Currently I am working on the following topics, for which no preprints are available yet:

- Influence of battery and demand response agents on electricity market emmissions under varying market conditions
- Optimal bidding strategies for battery and demand response agents 
- Sparse positive semidefinite relaxations for water networks problems
- Positive semidefinite hierarchies for the maximum measurable distance avoiding set problem
